# USACO Algorithm Training Problems

My solutions to [USACO training problems](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=training).

Solutions are done in Python 3.

## Motivation

After reading a [blog post about callback hell](), one line resonated with me a lot:

> [young developers should practice algorithms more](https://sites.google.com/site/codetrick/usacocontents) and spend less time building iPhone apps

The author linked to his solutions of USACO training problems, which I have never happened upon before.

As a young developer who spent the early years of his career building iPhone apps, I'm hoping this is a fun way to practice algorithms.
